1. This is a very simple, pure C++ script which can do mathematics calculations.
2. ~~I will update it with more flexible functions and exception handlers.~~
3. It has been updated with functions and exceptions, that make it more efficient.
4. Calculator.cpp file is the older version with basic code. While the Calc_fun.cpp is the updated version with functions and exceptions.
5. Provide feedback. Its really appreciated. ^_^
6. Thank u.
